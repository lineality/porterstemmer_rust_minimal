# porterstemmer_rust_minimal

A Rust implementation of the classic Porter Stemmer, based on the original
ansi c code by Martin Porter (~1980). 
The algorithm reduces a single English "word" to a stem,
base, or root form through a series of systematic steps.

This rust code is specifically based on the
"cannonical" ansi c version by Martin Porter posted on 
Martin Porter's site: https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/c.txt

Thanks to 'NLP in Action' (Manning) for covering the Porter Stemmer.
